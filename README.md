Astramiz is a project to investigate methods for autonomous sail powered unmanned surface vechiles (USVs) opperating in the Arctic marginal ice zone to detect ice around them and navigate around it. This will allow for increased survivability and greater efficency for sail powered USVs opperating in the Arctic.

The first stage of the project was completed from January 2025 to May 2025 and consisted of a literature review and expert interviews to better understand the state of sail powered USVs, Arctic navigation, and ice detection.

The second stage of the project will be completed from August 2025 to November 2025 and will consist of testing SONAR, camera, and potentially RADAR systems to determine their efficacy for ice detection. It will also consist of intial testing of our USV testbed.

The third stage of the project will be completed from December 2025 to March 2026 and will consist of writing the software to allow for autonomous sailing of the testbed USV as well as integrating ice detection sensors into the USV.

The fourth stage of the project will be completed from March 2026 to May 2026 and will consist of integreating the ice detection sensors into the autonomy code.
